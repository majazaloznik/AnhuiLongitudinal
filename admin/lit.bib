abstract = {This dissertation consists of three independent papers, investigating how migration of working age adults from rural to urban areas in China influences intergenerational transfers, living arrangements, and the psychological well-being of elders who were raised and are embedded in the patrilineal family system. Analyses were performed using data from a three-wave longitudinal survey, the Longitudinal Study of Older People in Anhui Province, China. Random effects regression analysis from the first study (4,101 parent-child dyads from 1,147 parents) showed that for the same amount of child care and financial help that elders provided, they reaped higher financial return from their adult migrant children than from their adult non-migrant children. In Chinese families, non-migrant children did not need to reciprocate for parents' help in the short run. However, because parents had higher bargaining power when they provided child care to migrant children and because parents' financial help to migrant children was a strategic investment, migrant children were obliged to pay back parents' help. In the second study, random effects logistic regression (803 to 1154 parent-child dyads corresponding to 513 to 735 parents) showed that whether an elder coresided with a child depended on elders' previous exchange with that child and elders' exchanges with the other siblings of that child. In the third study, analyses based on cross-lagged effects model (1281 parents) indicated that depressive symptoms were usually reduced by assistance from daughters-in-law, and increased sometimes when such support was from sons. These relationships held most strongly when mothers coresided with their daughters-in-law. This research suggested that the benefits of intergenerational support were conditional on culturally prescribed expectations. Taken together, this dissertation demonstrated that the migration of adult children had substantial influence on the intergenerational transfer behaviors, the living arrangements of elders, and the effects of intergenerational transfers on elders' psychological well-being.},

abstract = {Objective: To study the possible associations between loneliness and social relationship (social support and family function) in Chinese empty nest elderly. Methods: A sample of 1144 empty nest elderly were surveyed using the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA)-Loneliness Scale, the Social Support Rate Scale and the Family Adaptability, Partnership, Growth, Affection and Resolve (APGAR) Index. Results: The present study revealed that the majority (80.94{\%}) of empty nest elderly had moderate to high levels of loneliness, with a mean score of 42.84 and a standardized score of 53.55. The level of loneliness was significantly different in subjects' age, marital status and income, but not in sex and education level. Social support and family function were significant negatively associated with loneliness. Multiple regression revealed that less social support and poor family function were associated with more loneliness. Conclusions: Loneliness prevails among empty nest elderly. It may limit empty nest elderly's ability or access to social relationship. These findings support the hypothesis that if empty nest elderly are better supported and cared for, their negative psychosocial consequences might be prevented or at least reduced.},

abstract = {This investigation examined how initial levels of elder parents' depressive symptoms influenced financial, instrumental, and emotional support from sons and from daughters in rural China. Data derived from a two-wave (2001, 2003) longitudinal survey of 1,324 parents aged 60 and over living in rural areas of Anhui Province, China. Structural Equation Modeling with latent difference score was used to estimate the reciprocal relatioships between children's support and elder parents' depressive symptoms. Results showed that older parents who had higher levels of depressive symptoms at baseline experienced reduced financial, instrumental, and emotional support from sons, but not from daughters. In rural China where the patrilineal family system has distinguished sons and daughters with respect to their functions in elder parents' support networks, the roles of sons and daughters warrant further examination, particularly when elder parents have some depressive symptoms, which elevates the needs of the parents and puts a strain on intergenerational relationships.},

abstract = {Objectives: This study examined potential differences among childless elders, elders with one child, and elders with multiple children in rural China in their levels of depression and life satisfaction, and investigated the mechanism behind the potential differences.Methods: The sample consisted of 1224 older adults in rural Anhui province, China. ANOVA tests were carried out to compare the three groups in depression and life satisfaction, respectively. Multiple regressions were carried out to predict depression and life satisfaction, with (1) parental status, (2) individual attributes (i.e., sociodemographic variables and functional health), and (3) variables representing family relations (i.e., living arrangement, intergenerational contact, and family support) entered sequentially in each regression.Results: Overall, childless elders in rural China had significantly higher level of depression and lower level of life satisfaction than did older parents. The primary reason for such group differences was lack of monetary support from adult children, the effect of which was conditioned upon the income level of older adults. With a high level of income, the benefit of monetary support from children was negligible. However, the mere presence of multiple children was associated with a higher life satisfaction, independent of personal attributes and potential monetary support from children.Conclusion: This study contributed to the ‘missing link' in the explanation by identifying the pathways through which parental status affect individual well-being. The findings indicate that local contexts such as affluence, social norms, and available formal support all play a role in shaping the consequences of childlessness in later life.},
